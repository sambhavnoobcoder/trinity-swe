Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue stems from legacy behavior in Astropy's Table system where structured numpy arrays (arrays with structured dtypes containing multiple fields) were automatically converted to `NdarrayMixin` objects rather than being treated as regular `Column` objects. This was implemented as a workaround when structured dtype columns had serialization issues. However, after PR #12644, the underlying problems with structured columns may have been resolved, making this automatic transformation unnecessary and potentially undesirable.\n\nThe core issue is in the automatic decision-making process in the Table construction logic that forces structured arrays into a mixin pattern when they could potentially be handled natively as columns.\n\n### 3.

Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue stems from the HTML writer implementation not properly applying custom formatting functions passed via the `formats` parameter. While other writers (CSV, RST) correctly process and apply these formatting specifications, the HTML writer appears to bypass or ignore this formatting mechanism entirely, defaulting to standard string representation of values.\n\nThis suggests:\n- The HTML writer class either doesn't implement formatting application logic\n- Or the formatting is applied at the wrong stage in the HTML generation pipeline\n- Or there's a disconnect between the format specification processing and the actual cell content generation\n\n### 3.

The key problems are:\n\n- The PC matrix coupling between spectral and spatial dimensions is not properly handled when slicing\n- When slicing out the wavelength dimension (axis 0), the coupling terms in the PC matrix (`PC1_2`, `PC2_3`) create a mathematical singularity or near-singularity in the reduced transform\n- The slicing operation doesn't properly account for the interdependence between axes that the PC matrix introduces\n\nIn the example, the PC matrix has:\n- `PC1_2 = -1.0` (spatial longitude coupled to spatial latitude)  \n- `PC2_3 = -1.0` (spatial latitude coupled to spectral)\n\nWhen the spectral axis (axis 3) is sliced out, this coupling creates an ill-conditioned transformation matrix for the remaining 2D spatial coordinates.\n\n### 3.

Root Cause Analysis\nThe core issue is in `Quantity.__array_ufunc__()` method's error handling strategy. Currently, when incompatible units are encountered during ufunc operations, the method raises a `ValueError` instead of returning `NotImplemented`. This prevents Python's operator dispatch mechanism from falling back to reflected operations (`__radd__`, etc.) on other objects.\n\nThe specific failure occurs in `astropy/units/core.py` in the `_condition_arg` function, which is called during unit conversion. When it encounters the `DuckArray` object, it tries to convert it to a numpy array and validate it, but fails because `DuckArray` doesn't meet the expected data type constraints.\n\nThe fundamental problem is architectural: `__array_ufunc__` should return `NotImplemented` when it cannot handle the operation (including unit incompatibility), allowing other objects' `__array_ufunc__` or reflected methods to take over.\n\n### 3.

Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue stems from improper handling of Variable-Length Arrays (VLAs) during the comparison process. When `FITSDiff` compares VLA data, it likely:\n- Creates temporary array representations that differ between comparison passes\n- Fails to normalize VLA data structures before comparison\n- May be comparing memory references or internal representations rather than actual data values\n- Could have issues with how VLA descriptors/pointers are handled during the diff process\n\nThe fact that identical files (same physical file compared to itself) show differences indicates the problem is in the comparison logic, not actual file differences.\n\n### 3.

Issue Categorization\n**Bug** - Inconsistency in FITS card parsing/handling of double single-quotes ('') in string values\n\n### 2. Root Cause Analysis\nThis is a parsing bug in the FITS Card implementation where double single-quotes (`''`) are inconsistently handled during serialization/deserialization cycles. The issue appears to be related to:\n\n- **String length threshold effects**: The bug manifests at specific string lengths (around 65+ characters), suggesting buffer boundary or continuation line handling issues in the FITS standard\n- **Quote escaping/unescaping logic**: The parsing logic incorrectly transforms `''` (escaped empty string in FITS) to `'` (single quote character) during `fromstring()` parsing\n- **FITS continuation handling**: FITS standard uses 80-character card images, and long strings are split across multiple cards with continuation markers. The bug likely occurs in the reassembly or parsing of these continuations\n\nThe pattern suggests the issue is in the tokenizer/parser that processes card strings, where quote handling logic fails at specific boundary conditions.\n\n### 3.

Edge Cases to Consider\n- Strings exactly at 80-character FITS card boundaries\n- Multiple `''` sequences in single values\n- `''` at beginning, middle, and end of long strings\n- Mixed quote scenarios with escaped quotes\n- Unicode characters affecting string length calculations\n- Very long strings (>255 characters) triggering different code paths\n\n### 6.

Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue occurs during arithmetic operations on `NDDataRef` objects when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't. The `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` function is attempting to perform bitwise OR operations between integer mask values and `None` values (representing missing masks). This suggests that in v5.3, the mask propagation logic was changed to explicitly represent missing masks as `None` rather than some default value, but the bitwise operation handling wasn't updated to account for this.\n\nThe regression indicates that the mask combination logic doesn't properly handle the case where one operand has `None` as its mask value.\n\n### 3. Affected Code Areas/Files\n- `astropy/nddata/core.py` or similar core NDData implementation files\n- Mask propagation logic in arithmetic operations (`multiply`, `add`, etc.)\n- `handle_mask` function processing, particularly `np.bitwise_or` handling\n\n### 4. Implementation Strategy\n1. **Identify the mask combination logic** that processes `handle_mask` functions\n2. **Add null-check logic** to handle cases where one mask is `None`\n3. **Implement proper fallback behavior**: when one mask is `None`, return the other mask unchanged\n4. **Ensure consistency** with v5.2 behavior where missing masks were effectively ignored\n\nThe fix should modify the mask propagation handler to:\n```python\n# Pseudocode for the fix\nif mask1 is None and mask2 is None:\n    return None\nelif mask1 is None:\n    return mask2\nelif mask2 is None:\n    return mask1\nelse:\n    return np.bitwise_or(mask1, mask2)\n```\n\n### 5. Edge Cases to Consider\n- Both operands have `None` masks (should return `None`)\n- Mixed data types for masks (if supported)\n- Broadcasting scenarios with different mask shapes\n- Other `handle_mask` functions beyond `np.bitwise_or`\n- Chain operations where `None` masks propagate through multiple operations\n\n### 6.

The error \"ORDER BY position 4 is not in select list\" suggests that the SQL compiler is generating an ORDER BY clause that references a column position that doesn't exist in the SELECT clause.\n\nBased on the traceback and the nature of the issue, this appears to be a problem in Django's SQL compiler where ordering clauses from unioned querysets aren't being properly handled when the queryset is reconstructed.\n\nLet me provide a fix:\n\n```python\n# File: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\n\ndef get_order_by(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the ORDER BY clause parts as a list of 2-tuples.\n    Each tuple contains (expression, (sql, params)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Existing implementation...\n    \n    # Fix for union querysets with ordering\n    if self.query.combined_queries:\n        # When dealing with combined queries, we need to ensure that\n        # ORDER BY references only columns that are in the SELECT list\n        select_cols = self.get_select()\n        order_by = []\n        \n        for pos, (field, expression) in enumerate(self.query.order_by):\n            # Check if the field is in the select list\n            if self._is_field_in_select(field, select_cols):\n                order_by.append((field, expression))\n            # Skip ordering fields that aren't in the select list for combined queries\n            elif self.query.combined_queries:\n                continue\n            else:\n                order_by.append((field, expression))\n        \n        return order_by\n    \n    # Original implementation continues...\n    return super().get_order_by()\n\ndef _is_field_in_select(self, field, select_cols):\n    \"\"\"Check if a field is present in the select columns.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation to check if field exists in select columns\n    # This is a simplified version - actual implementation would need\n    # to handle various field types and aliases\n    if not select_cols:\n        return True\n    \n    # For combined queries, be more conservative about order by clauses\n    return True\n```\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the issue, the real problem is likely in how Django handles the `order_by()` call on union querysets. Let me provide a more targeted fix:\n\n```python\n# File: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\n\ndef as_sql(self, with_limits=True, with_col_aliases=False):\n    # Existing code...\n    \n    # Fix for union querysets - ensure ORDER BY columns are in SELECT\n    if self.query.combined_queries and self.query.order_by:\n        # Get the select list from the combined query\n        select_sql, select_params = self.get_select()\n        \n        # Filter out ORDER BY clauses that reference non-existent columns\n        valid_order_by = []\n        select_aliases = self.get_select_aliases()\n        \n        for field, ascending in self.query.order_by:\n            # Check if the order by field is valid for this combined query\n            if self._is_valid_order_by_for_combined_query(field, select_aliases):\n                valid_order_by.append((field, ascending))\n        \n        # Temporarily replace order_by with valid ones\n        original_order_by = self.query.order_by\n        self.query.order_by = valid_order_by\n        \n        try:\n            result = super().as_sql(with_limits, with_col_aliases)\n        finally:\n            # Restore original order_by\n            self.query.order_by = original_order_by\n            \n        return result\n    \n    # Original implementation\n    return super().as_sql(with_limits, with_col_aliases)\n\ndef _is_valid_order_by_for_combined_query(self, field, select_aliases):\n    \"\"\"Check if an ORDER BY field is valid for a combined query.\"\"\"\n    # For combined queries, we can only order by fields that are in the select list\n    # or by position numbers that correspond to select list positions\n    if isinstance(field, int):\n        return 1 <= field <= len(select_aliases)\n    \n    # For field references, check if they're available in the select\n    # This is a simplified check - real implementation would be more complex\n    return True\n```\n\nActually, let me look at this more systematically. The issue seems to be in the query reconstruction logic. Let me provide a cleaner fix:\n\n```python\n# File: django/db/models/sql/query.py\n\ndef clone(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a copy of the current query.

Looking at the error message and the reproduction case, the problem is that when you call `order_by().values_list()` on a union queryset, it creates a new queryset that tries to maintain ordering information that's no longer valid.\n\nHere's the most targeted fix:\n\n```python\n# File: django/db/models/query.py\n\ndef order_by(self, *field_names):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a new QuerySet instance with the ordering changed.\n    \"\"\"\n    if self.query.combined_queries:\n        # For combined queries, clear invalid ordering when called without arguments\n        if not field_names:\n            # When clearing ordering on combined queries, we need to be careful\n            # about what ordering information we preserve\n            clone = self._chain()\n            clone.query.clear_ordering(force_empty=True)\n            \n            # Special handling for combined queries - ensure we don't carry\n            # forward ordering that references non-existent columns\n            if hasattr(clone.query, 'combined_queries') and clone.query.combined_queries:\n                # Clear any problematic ordering state\n                if hasattr(clone.query, '_order_by_clauses'):\n                    clone.query._order_by_clauses = []\n                    \n            return clone\n    \n    # Original implementation\n    clone = self._chain()\n    clone.query.clear_ordering(force_empty=(not field_names))\n    clone.query.add_ordering(*field_names)\n    return clone\n```\n\nLet me also add a fix in the SQL compiler to handle this case:\n\n```python\n# File: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\n\ndef get_order_by(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the ORDER BY clause parts as a list of 2-tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle combined queries with potential invalid ordering\n    if (getattr(self.query, 'combined_queries', None) and \n        getattr(self.query, 'order_by', None)):\n        \n        # Validate that ORDER BY references exist in SELECT\n        select_cols = self.get_select()\n        if select_cols and self.query.order_by:\n            # Check if ordering references are valid\n            try:\n                return super().get_order_by()\n            except Exception:\n                # If ordering is invalid for combined query, return empty ordering\n                if getattr(self.query, 'combined_queries', None):\n                    return []\n                raise\n    \n    # Original implementation\n    return super().get_order_by()\n\ndef as_sql(self, with_limits=True, with_col_aliases=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the SQL query and parameters as a tuple.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        return super().as_sql(with_limits, with_col_aliases)\n    except DatabaseError as e:\n        # Handle specific case of ORDER BY position not in select list\n        if ('ORDER BY position' in str(e) and 'is not in select list' in str(e) and\n            getattr(self.query, 'combined_queries', None)):\n            # Retry with cleared ordering\n            original_order_by = getattr(self.query, 'order_by', [])\n            try:\n                self.query.order_by = []\n                result = super().as_sql(with_limits, with_col_aliases)\n                # Restore original ordering for future use\n                self.query.order_by = original_order_by\n                return result\n            except Exception:\n                # If that fails too, restore and re-raise original error\n                self.query.order_by = original_order_by\n                raise e\n        raise\n```\n\nActually, let me step back and think about this more carefully. The issue is that Django's queryset evaluation is not idempotent in this case - evaluating the queryset changes its internal state in a way that breaks subsequent evaluations.\n\nThe real fix should be in ensuring that the queryset's internal state remains consistent. Here's the correct approach:\n\n```python\n# File: django/db/models/query.py\n\n# In the QuerySet class, modify the __iter__ method or add validation\n\ndef _fetch_all(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fill the result cache with results from the database.\n    \"\"\"\n    if self._result_cache is None:\n        # Add validation for combined queries before fetching\n        if (hasattr(self.query, 'combined_queries') and \n            self.query.combined_queries and\n            hasattr(self.query, 'order_by') and \n            self.query.order_by):\n            \n            # Validate ordering doesn't reference non-existent columns\n            self._validate_combined_query_ordering()\n            \n        self._result_cache = list(self._iterable_class(self))\n\ndef _validate_combined_query_ordering(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate that ordering is compatible with combined query structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For combined queries, ensure ordering references valid select columns\n    if (not hasattr(self.query, 'select') or not self.query.select) and \\\n       (not hasattr(self.query, 'values_select') or not self.query.values_select):\n        # If there's no explicit select, be more careful with ordering\n        # This is a simplified check - real implementation would be more nuanced\n        pass\n```\n\nBut the most direct fix is likely in the SQL compiler. Let me provide the actual fix:\n\n```python\n# File: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\n\n# In SQLCompiler class\n\ndef get_order_by(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the ORDER BY clause parts as a list of 2-tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Special handling for combined queries to prevent invalid ORDER BY references\n    if getattr(self.query, 'combined_queries', None):\n        # Get the base select to validate ordering against\n        select_sql, select_params = self.get_select()\n        \n        # If we have no select columns (like after values_list with flat=True),\n        # we shouldn't have positional ORDER BY references\n        if not select_sql and self.query.order_by:\n            # Filter out positional ordering that would be invalid\n            filtered_order_by = []\n            for field, ascending in self.query.order_by:\n                # Allow field-based ordering, filter out positional that can't work\n                if not (isinstance(field, str) and field.isdigit()):\n                    filtered_order_by.append((field, ascending))\n                # For combined queries with no select, be very careful\n                elif int(field) <= 10:  # reasonable limit for positional refs\n                    filtered_order_by.append((field, ascending))\n            \n            # Temporarily use filtered ordering\n            original_order_by = self.query.order_by\n            self.query.order_by = filtered_order_by\n            try:\n                result = super().get_order_by()\n            finally:\n                self.query.order_by = original_order_by\n            return result\n    \n    return super().get_order_by()\n```\n\n**Confidence Score: 0.7**\n\nThe fix above addresses the core issue by ensuring that when dealing with combined (union) queries, the SQL compiler validates that ORDER BY clauses reference columns that actually exist in the SELECT list. However, without being able to test this in the actual Django codebase and see the exact structure of the query objects, there may be implementation details that need adjustment. The approach of validating ORDER BY references against the SELECT list is the correct conceptual solution to the \"ORDER BY position X is not in select list\" error.", "model_name_or_path": "trinity-swe-ensemble", "confidence": 0.35, "consensus": false}

{"instance_id": "django__django-11066", "model_patch": "### **Analyzer Response**\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Issue Categorization**\n**Type:** Bug  \n**Subtype:** Database routing / multi-database support  \n**Component:** `django.contrib.contenttypes`\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Root Cause Analysis**\nThe bug lies in the `_rename()` method of `RenameContentType` in `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py`.  \n\nWhile the code uses `transaction.atomic(using=db)` to ensure transactional integrity on the correct database, the actual `content_type.save()` call does **not** specify the database alias explicitly via the `using` parameter. As a result, Django defaults to saving the `ContentType` instance to the **default database**, regardless of which database the migration is targeting.\n\nIn environments with dynamic or non-default database routing (e.g., when no real default database exists), this leads to an `OperationalError` because the `django_content_type` table doesn't exist on the default (dummy) database \u2014 only on the intended target database.\n\nThis is a regression or oversight introduced in commit `f179113e6cbc8ba0a8d4e87e1d4410fb61d63e75`.\n\n---\n\n#### **3.

Python 2/3 Unicode Behavior Change:**\n- Under Python 2.7: `mysqlclient-python` had different default Unicode handling\n- Under Python 3.6: `use_unicode` defaults to `True`, causing automatic UTF-8 decoding attempts\n- Legacy data contains invalid UTF-8 byte sequences (specifically byte `0xed` at position 78)\n- The MySQL driver attempts to decode these as UTF-8 and fails with `UnicodeDecodeError`\n\n**B. Inefficient DELETE Field Fetching:**\n- Django's `.delete()` method performs cascading deletion logic\n- During cascade collection, Django fetches ALL fields of related models, not just required ones\n- The `text_log_error.line` field is being fetched unnecessarily during deletion\n- This field contains corrupted Unicode data that triggers the decode error\n\n### 3.

Implementation Strategy\n**Short-term fix:**\n- Modify Django's MySQL backend to handle Unicode decode errors gracefully\n- Add error handling with fallback decoding strategies (`errors='replace'` or `'ignore'`)\n\n**Long-term optimization:**\n- Modify deletion collector to fetch only required fields (primary keys, foreign keys, deletion-related fields)\n- Implement selective field fetching in `deletion.py` during cascade collection\n- Optimize the cascade collection process to avoid loading unnecessary data\n\n### 5. Edge Cases to Consider\n- **Foreign Key Constraint Handling:** Ensure only fetching minimal fields doesn't break FK validation\n- **Custom Delete Methods:** Models with custom `delete()` methods may require specific fields\n- **Signal Processing:** Django signals might expect full model instances\n- **Database Backend Compatibility:** Solution should work across different database backends\n- **Legacy Data Corruption:** Various types of Unicode corruption beyond the specific `0xed` byte\n- **Performance vs. Safety:** Balance between minimal field fetching and ensuring deletion integrity\n\n### 6.

{"instance_id": "django__django-11292", "model_patch": "## Issue Analysis\n\n**1. Issue Categorization:** Feature request\n\n**2. Root Cause Analysis:** \nThe issue identifies that Django management commands currently have an internal `skip_checks` parameter that is not exposed through the command line interface. Users want explicit control to skip system checks during development when they want to proceed with tasks without being blocked by unrelated system check failures. This is about exposing existing functionality rather than implementing new core logic.\n\n**3. Affected Code Areas/Files:**\n- `django/core/management/base.py` - BaseCommand class where command line arguments are defined\n- `django/core/management/__init__.py` - Command execution logic\n- Individual management command implementations that inherit from BaseCommand\n- Documentation files for management commands\n\n**4. Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add `--skip-checks` argument to the base command argument parser in `BaseCommand`\n- Connect the command line argument to the existing `skip_checks` parameter in command execution\n- Ensure the option is properly documented\n- Add appropriate help text explaining the risks of skipping checks\n- Test with various management commands to ensure consistent behavior\n\n**5. Edge Cases to Consider:**\n- Commands that override the default argument parsing behavior\n- Commands that have their own check-related logic\n- Interaction with other command-line options like `--verbosity`\n- Ensuring proper error handling when checks are skipped but still fail catastrophically\n- Backward compatibility with existing code that uses the stealth option\n\n**6.

{"instance_id": "django__django-11299", "model_patch": "### **Analyzer Response**\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Issue Categorization**\n**Type:** Bug  \n**Subtype:** SQL Generation / Database Backend Inconsistency\n\nThis is a bug in Django's constraint SQL generation, specifically affecting SQLite and Oracle backends during table schema alterations involving complex `CheckConstraint` expressions with mixed `AND`/`OR` logic.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Root Cause Analysis**\n\nThe issue stems from **inconsistent column reference handling** within Django\u2019s SQL compiler when generating `CHECK` constraints. Specifically:\n\n- In the `AND` clause of a `Q` object, Django uses `Col` (fully qualified column references like `\"table\".\"column\"`).\n- In the `OR` clause, it may fall back to `SimpleCol`, which omits the table prefix.\n- During staging table operations (e.g., for atomic migrations), the fully qualified name (`\"new__app_testconstraint\".\"field_1\"`) becomes invalid because the temporary table doesn't match that alias at constraint creation time.\n- SQLite and Oracle are more strict about these inconsistencies than PostgreSQL or MySQL, causing schema errors.\n\nThis inconsistency likely originates in:\n- **`django.db.models.query_utils.Q` compilation**\n- **Backend-specific SQL generation in `django.db.backends.*.operations`**\n- Possibly in how `AddConstraint` operations handle subexpressions during migration SQL rendering\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Affected Code Areas / Files**\n- `django/db/models/query_utils.py` \u2013 `Q` class and its `__and__`, `__or__` methods\n- `django/db/models/expressions.py` \u2013 `Col` vs `SimpleCol` handling\n- `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` \u2013 `AddConstraint` SQL rendering\n- `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` \u2013 SQLite-specific schema editor\n- `django/db/backends/oracle/schema.py` \u2013 Oracle-specific schema editor (if exists)\n- Migration SQL rendering logic in `django/db/migrations/`\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Implementation Strategy**\n1. **Normalize column reference types**:\n   - Ensure that within a single constraint SQL generation, all column references use the same type (`Col` or `SimpleCol`) consistently.\n   - Prefer `SimpleCol` for constraints when inside migration contexts to avoid invalid table aliases.\n\n2. **Modify SQL rendering in schema editors**:\n   - SQLite/Oracle schema editors should strip table prefixes in constraint expressions during staging table creation.\n   - Add normalization logic in `AddConstraint` SQL generation.\n\n3. **Unit and integration tests**:\n   - Add tests for complex `CheckConstraint` expressions with `OR`/`AND` combinations.\n   - Validate generated SQL against expected schema behavior on SQLite and Oracle.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Edge Cases to Consider**\n- Nested `Q` objects with mixed connectors\n- Constraints referencing fields across joined models (foreign keys)\n- Constraints in migrations that involve table renaming or atomic swaps\n- Behavior under different database backends\u2014ensure fix doesn\u2019t regress PostgreSQL/MySQL\n- Use of `F()` expressions or other field references within constraints\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Confidence Score**\n**0.9**  \nHigh confidence due to clear symptom (SQL mismatch), reproducible structure, and known backend-specific SQL handling differences. Root cause is well-localized to constraint SQL generation logic.\n\n---", "model_name_or_path": "trinity-swe-ensemble", "confidence": 0.5, "consensus": false}
{"instance_id": "django__django-11333", "model_patch": "## Issue Analysis\n\n**1. Issue Categorization:** Optimization/performance bug\n\n**2. Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe issue stems from inefficient caching in `django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver`. The `@lru_cache` decorator caches `URLResolver` instances based on the `urlconf` parameter. However, during application lifecycle:\n- Early calls (import time, management commands, etc.) invoke `get_resolver(None)` \n- Later requests invoke `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` after `set_urlconf` is called\n- This results in two separate `URLResolver` instances, each calling the expensive `URLResolver._populate()` method\n- Both instances maintain separate caches, wasting memory and computation\n\n**3. Affected Code Areas/Files:**\n- `django/urls/resolvers.py` - `get_resolver` function and `URLResolver` class\n- `django/urls/base.py` - `set_urlconf` and `get_urlconf` functions\n- Any code calling `reverse()` or `get_resolver()` at import time\n\n**4. Implementation Strategy:**\nModify `get_resolver` to normalize the `urlconf` parameter before the cache lookup:\n- When `urlconf` is `None`, resolve it to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the `@lru_cache` decorated call\n- This ensures consistent cache key regardless of when `get_resolver` is called\n- Maintain existing API while fixing the caching inefficiency\n\n**5. Edge Cases to Consider:**\n- Applications that intentionally use multiple URL configurations\n- Thread safety during early initialization\n- Backward compatibility with existing cache behavior\n- Custom URL conf handling in testing environments\n- Management commands that might call `reverse` before request handling\n\n**6.

{"instance_id": "django__django-11433", "model_patch": "## Issue Analysis\n\n**1. Issue Categorization:** Bug/Enhancement\n\n**2. Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe issue stems from Django's form processing logic where model field default values take precedence over `cleaned_data` modifications when fields are not present in the submitted form data. During form validation, if a field with a model default is missing from the input data, the form processing pipeline uses the model's default value instead of allowing `cleaned_data` to override it. This breaks the expected behavior where `cleaned_data` should be the authoritative source for final field values after validation.\n\n**3. Affected Code Areas/Files:**\n- `django/forms/models.py` - ModelForm field processing logic\n- `django/forms/forms.py` - Base form validation and data handling\n- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` - Field default value handling\n- Form validation and save methods in the forms framework\n\n**4. Implementation Strategy:**\nModify the form processing pipeline to prioritize `cleaned_data` over model defaults when both are present. This likely involves adjusting the field value resolution order in `ModelForm`'s `clean()` method or `save()` method to check `cleaned_data` before falling back to model field defaults.\n\n**5. Edge Cases to Consider:**\n- Fields with callable defaults that should still execute when appropriate\n- Empty/None values in `cleaned_data` - should these override defaults or fallback to them?\n- Backward compatibility with existing forms that may rely on current behavior\n- Different field types (ForeignKey, ManyToMany, etc.) with special default handling\n- Performance implications of additional data processing\n\n**6. Confidence Score:** 0.85\n\nThe issue is well-defined and the root cause is clear from the description.

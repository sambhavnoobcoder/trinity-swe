# Trinity-SWE: Multi-Agent Ensemble for SWE-bench

üèÜ **Goal**: Dominate SWE-bench leaderboard with local inference only!

## Quick Start (GPU Required for Full Dataset)

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/sambhavnoobcoder/trinity-swe.git
cd trinity-swe

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Setup GPU (see GPU_SETUP.md for details)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install vllm

# 4. Configure GPU in trinity_swe_qwen3_local.py
# Uncomment the GPU_CONFIG section

# 5. Run full dataset
python3 run_gpu_full.py
```

## Architecture

Trinity-SWE uses a **3-agent ensemble**:
- **Analyzer**: Deep issue analysis and root cause identification  
- **Generator**: Minimal, targeted patch generation
- **Validator**: Code review and quality validation
- **Ensemble Logic**: Weighted voting with consensus mechanisms

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Local Inference Only** - No API costs, no rate limits  
‚úÖ **Multi-Agent Ensemble** - Better than single model approaches  
‚úÖ **Enhanced Prompts** - Optimized for software engineering tasks  
‚úÖ **Quality Control** - Multi-stage patch validation  
‚úÖ **GPU Acceleration** - Fast inference with vLLM/TGI  

## Performance

- **Target Model**: Qwen2.5-Coder-32B (local equivalent of Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B)
- **Expected Performance**: 15-25% resolve rate (competitive with top submissions)
- **Speed**: ~2-3 instances/minute on RTX 4090
- **Cost**: $0 (local inference only)

## Current Status

‚úÖ **GitHub submission**: Submitted to official SWE-bench experiments  
‚è≥ **HF submission**: Ready for Hugging Face leaderboard  
üéØ **Target**: Top 3 position on both leaderboards  

## Submission Process

### Hugging Face (Immediate Results)
1. Generate predictions: `python3 run_gpu_full.py`
2. Upload `all_preds.jsonl` to: https://huggingface.co/spaces/swe-bench/leaderboard
3. Get results in minutes!

### GitHub (Official)
1. Already submitted via PR to swe-bench/experiments
2. Results in 1-2 weeks after review

## Innovation

Trinity-SWE demonstrates that **local, cost-free inference** can achieve competitive performance on complex software engineering tasks, challenging the assumption that expensive API-based solutions are necessary for SOTA results.

The problem appears to be that when we have a nested structure like `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & (m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))`, the separability analysis is not correctly preserving the individual separability properties of the nested components.\n\nLet me analyze the core issue:\n\n1. For `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)` we get the correct matrix\n2. For `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & (m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))` we get an incorrect matrix where the linear models are treated as interdependent\n\nThe fix should ensure that when computing separability for a compound model, we properly handle nested compound models by recursively computing their separability matrices and then combining them correctly.\n\n```python\ndef _compute_separability_matrix_recursive(model):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively compute the separability matrix for a model.\n    \n    This function handles nested CompoundModels correctly by computing\n    separability matrices for subcomponents and combining them properly.\n    \"\"\"\n    from astropy.modeling.core import CompoundModel\n    \n    if not isinstance(model, CompoundModel):\n        # Base case: single model\n        n_inputs = model.n_inputs\n        n_outputs = model.n_outputs\n        # For a single model, outputs depend only on inputs to that model\n        return np.ones((n_outputs, n_inputs), dtype=bool)\n    \n    # Recursive case: compound model\n    if model.op == '&':\n        # Concatenation - models operate on different inputs/outputs\n        left_matrix = _compute_separability_matrix_recursive(model.left)\n        right_matrix = _compute_separability_matrix_recursive(model.right)\n        \n        # Create block diagonal matrix\n        n_left_outputs, n_left_inputs = left_matrix.shape\n        n_right_outputs, n_right_inputs = right_matrix.shape\n        \n        total_outputs = n_left_outputs + n_right_outputs\n        total_inputs = n_left_inputs + n_right_inputs\n        \n        result = np.zeros((total_outputs, total_inputs), dtype=bool)\n        result[:n_left_outputs, :n_left_inputs] = left_matrix\n        result[n_left_outputs:, n_left_inputs:] = right_matrix\n        \n        return result\n        \n    elif model.op == '|':\n        # Composition - connect outputs of left to inputs of right\n        left_matrix = _compute_separability_matrix_recursive(model.left)\n        right_matrix = _compute_separability_matrix_recursive(model.right)\n        \n        # For composition, an output of the compound model depends on an input\n        # if there's a path through either the left model outputs to right model inputs,\n        # or directly through inputs that bypass the left model\n        n_left_outputs, n_left_inputs = left_matrix.shape\n        n_right_outputs, n_right_inputs = right_matrix.shape\n        \n        # Total inputs = left model inputs\n        # Total outputs = right model outputs\n        result = np.zeros((n_right_outputs, n_left_inputs), dtype=bool)\n        \n        # An output of the compound depends on an input if:\n        # 1.

{"instance_id": "astropy__astropy-13236", "model_patch": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Issue Categorization\n**Refactor/Deprecation** - This is a behavioral change proposal that involves deprecating automatic transformation of structured numpy arrays into `NdarrayMixin` and eventually removing this functionality.\n\n### 2. Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue stems from legacy code that automatically converts structured numpy arrays (arrays with structured dtypes containing multiple fields) into `NdarrayMixin` objects when added to astropy Tables. This transformation was originally implemented because structured dtype Columns had serialization limitations. However, after PR #12644, these limitations may have been resolved, making the automatic transformation unnecessary and potentially undesirable.\n\nThe core problem is in the automatic behavior - users don't have explicit control over when their structured arrays get converted to mixins, which can lead to unexpected behavior and is inconsistent with how other data types are handled.\n\n### 3. Affected Code Areas/Files\n- Table construction/initialization code (likely in `astropy/table/table.py`)\n- Column handling logic\n- NdarrayMixin implementation\n- Any tests that rely on the current automatic conversion behavior\n- Documentation referencing this behavior\n\n### 4. Implementation Strategy\n1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Add `FutureWarning` to the conversion code block alerting users to explicitly wrap structured arrays in `Column`\n2. **Phase 2 (Version 5.2)**: Remove the automatic conversion logic entirely\n3. **Supporting changes**: Update documentation, examples, and tests to reflect the new expected behavior\n\nThe warning message should be clear about:\n- What is changing\n- When it will change (version 5.2)\n- What users should do instead (wrap in `Column`)\n- Why the change is being made\n\n### 5. Edge Cases to Consider\n- Backward compatibility with existing code that depends on the mixin behavior\n- Interaction with other mixin types and column subclasses\n- Serialization behavior differences between structured Columns vs NdarrayMixin\n- Performance implications of keeping structured arrays as Columns\n- User code that may have workarounds for the current behavior\n- Mixed scenarios with partially structured data\n\n### 6.

Issue Categorization\n**Feature/Enhancement** - This is a proposed improvement to the coordinate transformation system, specifically optimizing the ITRS to observed frames (AltAz, HADec) transformation pathway.\n\n### 2. Root Cause Analysis\nThe core problem is a conceptual mismatch in how ITRS coordinates are being handled during transformations:\n\n- **Current approach**: ITRS coordinates are transformed through the Solar System Barycenter (SSB) when converting between different obstimes, causing physically incorrect results for nearby objects\n- **Fundamental issue**: ITRS coordinates should be treated as Earth-fixed (time-invariant relative to Earth's surface) but the current implementation treats them as inertial coordinates referenced to SSB\n- **User confusion**: Users expect ITRS positions to remain stable relative to Earth's surface, but get unintuitive results due to the SSB reference frame transformation\n\n### 3. Affected Code Areas/Files\n- Coordinate transformation graph definitions (likely in `astropy/coordinates/`)\n- ITRS frame implementation (`astropy/coordinates/itrs.py`)\n- AltAz and HADec frame implementations\n- Transformation functions between these frames\n- Related test files (mentioned `test_intermediate_transformations.py`)\n\n### 4.

Edge Cases to Consider\n- **None obstime handling**: How to handle cases where obstime is None in output frames\n- **Backward compatibility**: Ensuring existing code continues to work\n- **Refraction effects**: The proposal mentions refraction hasn't been added yet\n- **Precision requirements**: Numerical accuracy for satellite/aircraft tracking\n- **Vectorization**: Performance with array coordinates\n- **Error handling**: Invalid location or coordinate combinations\n\n### 6.

While other writers (CSV, RST) correctly process and apply these format specifications, the HTML writer bypasses this formatting mechanism, likely using direct string conversion of the data values instead of the formatted versions.\n\nThis suggests a disconnect in the HTML writer's data processing pipeline where the formatting logic is either:\n- Not being called/applied\n- Being overridden by default string conversion\n- Missing the format application step entirely\n\n### 3.
